# PyGEM-notebooks
Included in this repository are a series of Jupyter notebooks intended to demonstrate the functionality of the [Python Glacier Evolution Model](https://github.com/drounce/PyGEM). These notebooks generally follow [PyGEM's documentation](https://pygem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Notebooks
- *run_calibration.ipynb*: demonstrates how to run PyGEM calibration routines<br>
- *run_simulation.ipynb*: demonstrates how to run individual or large-scale (regional) glacier simulations<br>
- *analyze_regional_change.ipynb*: demonstrates how to aggregate individual glacier simulations by region and climate scenario, and analyze the resulting regional change<br>
- *analyze_mcmc.ipynb*: demonstrates how to analyze the prior and posterior model parameters for an individual glacier following **MCMC** model calibration<br>
- *analyze_mcmc_regional.ipynb*: demonstrates how to analyze the performance of **MCMC** calibration for an entire region<br>
