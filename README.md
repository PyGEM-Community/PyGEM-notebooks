# PyGEM-notebooks
Included in this repository are a series of Jupyter notebooks intended to demonstrate the functionality of the [Python Glacier Evolution Model](https://github.com/drounce/PyGEM). These notebooks generally follow [PyGEM's documentation](https://pygem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

>**Note:** These notebooks are set up to run with PyGEM>=v1.0.0 (which is currently in pre-release)

## Notebooks
- [simple_test](https://github.com/btobers/PyGEM-notebooks/blob/main/simple_test.ipynb): simple introductory PyGEM test run using provided sample data for Khumbu Glacier<br>
- [advanced_test](https://github.com/btobers/PyGEM-notebooks/blob/main/advanced_test.ipynb): a more advanced PyGEM test run, demonstrating Bayesian inference calibration and simulation, using provided sample data for Khumbu Glacier<br>
- [run_calibration](https://github.com/btobers/PyGEM-notebooks/blob/main/run_calibration.ipynb): demonstrates how to run PyGEM calibration routines<br>
- [run_simulation](https://github.com/btobers/PyGEM-notebooks/blob/main/run_simulation.ipynb): demonstrates how to run individual or large-scale (regional) glacier simulations<br>
- [analyze_regional_change](https://github.com/btobers/PyGEM-notebooks/blob/main/analyze_regional_change.ipynb): demonstrates how to aggregate individual glacier simulations by region and climate scenario, and analyze the resulting regional change<br>
- [analyze_mcmc](https://github.com/btobers/PyGEM-notebooks/blob/main/analyze_mcmc.ipynb): demonstrates how to analyze the prior and posterior model parameters for an individual glacier following **MCMC** model calibration<br>
- [analyze_mcmc_regional](https://github.com/btobers/PyGEM-notebooks/blob/main/analyze_mcmc_regional.ipynb): demonstrates how to analyze the performance of **MCMC** calibration for an entire region<br>

## To-Do
- Notebook demonstrating animations of PyGEM projections in 2d following ice redistribution
- Frontal ablation calibration for tidewater glaciers
